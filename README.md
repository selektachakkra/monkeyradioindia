Monkey Radio India
================

Monkey Radio India responsive website is the in-progress website to display and categorize all
mixes from the popular Monkey Radio India cloud. This application aims at collecting all recent mixes thorugh 
ajax calls through the mixcloud api and sorting this content to display mixes in a better fashion.

A lean methodology is being used with hopefully thorough user testing, to come back and redesign the application 
iteratively. A mobile first approach for the responsive design is being followed to keep the code clear and 
concise and allow it to perform better.

The code is currently open source and if you have any thoughts or performance fixes, feel free to fork it.
Also observe that the show names and the links are being hardcoded as we hadn't really planned this in a better 
fashion.

Some intended functinalities to be built are - 
1. Sorting based on dates.
2. Some kind of a search fucntionality.
3. Some way to accomodate description and tags.
